#you can space them appart if you don't want to run 5 strings of code instead of just 1 by spacing them appart like
#h = hello world
#print(h)
#Thats it for variables part 2
#There is differnt syntax if all the variabels are the same e.g
#Spongebob = Patrick = Sandy = Squidward = 30
#print (Spongebob, Patrick, Sandy, Squidward)
#>>>30 30 30 30
