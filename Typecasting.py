#Here we go, Typecasting!
#Type casting = convert the data type of a variable to another data type
x = 1 #int
y = 2.0 #float
z = '3' #str

#Convert y into a int use print(int(y))
#This is not perm, if you want to it be perm then you'd need to reasign it orrrr this:
y = str(y)
z = int(z)
#You can do this with str too, so if you want to preform math with a str then make the str a int, then print(z*3)
#x is lonly, make him float usinf the x = float(x)
x = str(x)
#1 becoms 1.0
#Conver int and float into a sting using the str cast, just replace int & float to str
#An example of using typecasting is when you need to conver an int or float to a str. Here's the situation, you need to print these variables along with another string, you'd use the print("X is"+x)
#but that doesnt work, thats why you use the print("x is" +str(x)) 
print("x is: " +str(x))
print("y is: " +str(y))
print(z*3)
